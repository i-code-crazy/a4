-	We need angular/cli because TS not direct compile in browser, so angular/cli compile TS into JS for browser.
-	angular/cli gives type time error for TS code.
- 	TS was addition of JS not replacement.
-	No need to write ".ts" at time of registering
- 	Use (`) for write inline component template and styles.
-	() => {} same as function(){}
-	we can pass events in methods like method($event) and get event data in TS file with pass perameter like (event : Event) and  (<HTMLInputElement>event.target).value
-	When you use ngModel then you need to follow this "import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'"
-	For [ngStyle] directive you can use style as camelcase Ex. {'background-color':'#000'} or {backgroundColor:'#000'}	
- 	Install jQuery - npm install jquery --save, Install types for jQuery - npm install @types/jquery --save, Import jQuery in app.module.ts - import 'jquery';
